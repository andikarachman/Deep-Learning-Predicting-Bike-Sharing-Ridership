# Deep Learning for Predicting Bike Sharing Ridership

This project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

In this project, we build a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users in a given day. By building a neural network from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. 

The data comes from the [**UCI Machine Learning Database**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
